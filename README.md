making a line trace by channel, vitrual methods in c++, creating and setting up AI pawns with Blackboards and Behavior Trees, 
creating a navmesh, creating custom behavior tree keys via c++, setting up randomized sounds effects and sound spacialization, 
and creating animation state machines were all learned and practiced from the online course.
